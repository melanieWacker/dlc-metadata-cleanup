dlc-metadata-cleanup
====================

Metadata remediation in preparation for ingest into DLC/Staff Viewer/etc. Primarily Omeka collections' metadata. 

This GitHub page will be used to store data, XSLT, and comments/issues found as the collections are ingested and reviewed by the metadata staff.

Omeka -> MODS workflow and documents:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Current Workflow (last updated July 2014):
* Digital Projects Librarian prioritizes exhibitions for remediation based on current needs and notifies metadata staff.
* Metadata staff download the bibliographic/descriptive metadata in bulk for each Omeka Collection.
* Metadata staff upload the metadata into OpenRefine for remediation following guidelines discussed in Workflow Meeting Notes.
* Once metadata is cleaned, Erin or Amber will upload CSV, Excel, OpenRefine project, and MODS/XML to the wiki page for that particular metadata collection.
* Once the metadata has been remediated and reviewed, metadata staff notifies the Digital Projects Librarian that the metadata is ready for ingest into Hyacinth.
* Digital Projects Librarian uploads the metadata into Hyacinth and publishes out to DLC, etc.
